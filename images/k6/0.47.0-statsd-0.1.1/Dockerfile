# This Dockerfile is used to create a Docker image containing your customized k6 binary.
#
# Once built, publish the resulting image to your publicly accessible container registry, e.g. https://hub.docker.com/.
# The published image will then be used to create your container(s) within the Kubernetes cluster.

# Stage 1: Setup Go environment and build custom k6 from sources using xk6 (https://github.com/grafana/xk6)
